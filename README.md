This is a proof of concept that got wild. Thus, things may change in the future and the code is a little rough around the edges. 


## tested enviroments

### desktop

* Google Chrome (latest)
* Firefox (latest)
* IE 9/10

### mobile

Mobile browsers are the main reason I started this project. It's a pain to test *x* websites on *n* mobile phones. Typing weird
urls during development can be really challenging on crappy phones...

* Android 2.3.x (stock browser)
* Android 4.1 (Chrome)
* Android 4.2 (Chrome)
* IOS 6 (with hickups)
